starbound-restarter
===================

Simple scripts for restarting a Starbound server automatically and providing a few bits of information on its status.

Written by atomfenrir for use on atomfenrir.com's Starbound server. These scripts are distributed with the MIT License.

## Why come?

There are already a few Starbound-oriented git repositories out there as of June, 2014, Starbound - Beta Enraged Koala update 8, but they haven't been able to do what I need for my own server. I suspect much of this is simply due to differences between Linux distros and Starbound versions. Most of these repositories were written shortly after Starbound was released, e.g. early 2014, when Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr was not yet available. I've only just started my server this June, so there's been a little bit of mileage between both Starbound's Beta development and the new Ubuntu LTS distro. 

## Requirements

Errr... a Linux based Starbound server? There isn't going to be a lot of testing on this, but I'm building it specifically for use on Ubuntu 14.04.

## Instructions

To be given when there are some actual working scripts involved. ;)

## Credit given where credit due

I don't expect to get a lot of community help on this here repository; this is just kind of a hobby thing for me. I am, however, a completely amateur programmer, so a few of the other repositories out there have definitely given me inspiration as to which direction I'm going to take this one:
